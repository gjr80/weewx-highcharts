v0.2.0
*   Removed hard coding of weeWX-WD bindings for appTemp and insolation. Now 
    attempts to otain bindings for each from weeWX-WD, if weeWX-WD is not 
    installed bindings are sought in weewx.conf [StdReport][[Highcharts]]. 
    If no binding can be found appTemp and insolation data is omitted and not 
    plotted.

*   initial release
