v0.2.2
*   Fixed bug in getDaySummaryVectors() that resulted in year wind direction 
    plot always displaying 90 degrees.
*   Minor reformatting of comments in various files
v0.2.1
*   Fixed bug with day/week windrose getSqlVectors call that resulted in
    'IndexError: list index out of range' error on line 962 in
    highchartsSearchX.py.
*   Fixed inconsistemt naming of [Extra][[WindRose]] stanza in skin.conf
    (this prevented weewx.conf values overriding those in skin.conf)
*   Fixed incorrect [Extras] settings in extension installer (setup.py)
    (this error was masked by the [Extras][[WindRose]] naming issue above)
v0.2.0
*   Removed hard coding of weeWX-WD bindings for appTemp and insolation. Now
    attempts to otain bindings for each from weeWX-WD, if weeWX-WD is not
    installed bindings are sought in weewx.conf [StdReport][[Highcharts]].
    If no binding can be found appTemp and insolation data is omitted and not
    plotted.
